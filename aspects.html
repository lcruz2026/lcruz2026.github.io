	<p><b>About my Favorite Characters and different things of the series</b></p>
</div>
<br>


<p><b>1. My Favorite Protagonist-</b> Josuke Higashikata (Part 4)</p>
	<div class="Reason">
		<p> Josuke is 16 year old highschool student who lives in the small town of Morioh. 
			He is the bastard son of Joseph Joestar (Protagonist of Part2).
			He is scary on the outside (mostly because of his appearance resembling a delinquent) but friendly on the inside.
			He can be described as clever, kind and dependable. 
			He also goes into a rage when you insult his hair which holdsa deep meaning to him.
		</p>
	</div>
<br>

<p><b>2. My Favorite Antagonist-</b> Yoshikage Kira (Part 4)</p>
	<div class="Reason">
		<p> Kira only wants a quiet life and I think that relatability is what drew me to him. 
		Compared to the motivations of other protagonists, his is simple and realistic but not being realistic isn't necessarily bad.
		He is charming and charismatic but he hides his true nature and intentions from the world.
		</p>
	</div>
<br>

<p><b>3. My Favorite Part-</b> Part 4</p>
	<div class="Reason">
		<p>This part takes place in Morioh, a small town in Japan. It follows the story of Josuke Higashikata and his friends. 
		It is somewhat Slice of Life-y but i enjoy it a lot since a lot of crazy things happen in this small town.
		I like to think the small setting helped in making the stories within more creative.
		</p>
	</div>
<br>

<p><b>4. My Favorite Side-Character-</b> Ceasar Zeppeli</p>
	<div class="Reason">
		<p>
		He is the son of William Zeppeli and both of them use Hamon, an ancient form of martial arts that 
		utilizes life energy. Ceasar uses Hamon to manipulate bubbles. The bubbles are a surprisingly good weapon
		and it leads to an interesting fighting style. Ceasar can be described as confident and short-tempered though 
		he has great respect for his elders and is very honorable.
		</p>
	</div>
<br>

<p><b>5. My Favorite Side-Villain-</b> Ghiacco</p>
	<div class="Reason">
		<p>
			Ghiacco is a member of an antagonistic group in part 5 called "La Squadra Esecuzioni". 
			The group is an assassination squad that works for "Passione", the main group in Part 5.
			He is very confident but short-tempered. He is also smart and prideful which leads to violent rants
			about language. He is dangerous in general, and even more so with his stand "White Album"

<p><b>6. My Favorite Anime Opening-</b> Bloody Stream</p>
	<div class="Reason">
		<p>
		It sounds the best out of all the Opening songs for the Anime in my opinion. The animation of the song 
		also has a crucial moment that just hits me somewhat emotionally.
