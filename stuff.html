<h1 id= Fav><b>My Fan-made Stands</b></h1>
<h3><b>About the stands I made for fun</b></h3>
<h6><b>(Stands are basically manifestations that represents someone's mind/fighting spirit. 
	You can think of them as powers represented using their own character)</b>
</h6>

<p><b>1.『Fireflies』- </b> The stand can release "spores" through its palms and mouth. The "spores"
are also released through punching. 
<br>
The spores are actually eggs that eventually hatch into firefly-like creatures.
The "fireflies"" bite anything they land on. 
<br>
When bitten by the "fireflies", it will cause a paralysis effect and 
the more times you get bit, the longer the effect lasts 
<br>
until the target is fully paralyzed. When they bite the user howver,
it will give them energy. The user can gain so much energy that they 
<br>
won't be able to sleep but fatigue is still felt. The "spores" are easily
moved by wind but they will stick to the first surface they land on.

</p>

<p><b>2.『Mad IQs』- </b> This Stand causes the target to slowly lose their sense of pain and 
	eventually their sense of touch. 
	<br>
	Ability activates when the user makes contact with the 
	target multiple times in the same spot
</p>

<p><b>3.『Two Moons』 - </b> The user can wear 1 of 2 "Moon Suits", one heavily focuses into 
	offense and one leans heavily into defense. 
	<br>
	The User can set the Defensive Suit to a 
	target wherein the suit will protect the target. When this happens, the user can switch 
	places with the suit at will.
</p>

<p><b>4.『Inside of my Heart』- </b> This stand is bound to a key that can open any door thathas a keyhole. 
	when a door is opened using the stand, 
	<br>
	it transforms the room. The interior is completely up to the user.
	Only one room can be changed at a time.
</p>

<p><b>5.『Soul Sister』-</b> The stand manifests as shapeshifting black ink. 
	Has the power to look into the target's mind. 
	<br>
	This abiltiy can be used to gather information from the target which appears as black text along the walls.
	The ability is also used to inflict fear.
